You need to cite all sources you rely on with in-text style. References should be in Harvard format.



part A(300 words)

There is a text file (“papers.txt” is uploaded in Moodle) about
computer science bibliography. Each line of this file describes the
details of one paper in the following format:
Authors|Title|Conference|Year. The different fields are separated by
the “|”character, and the list of authors are separated by commas (“,”).
An example line is given below:
D Zhang, J Wang, D Cai, J Lu|Self-Taught Hashing for Fast Similarity Search|SIGIR|2010
You can assume that there are no duplicate records, and each distinct
author or conference as a different name.
TASK: Please write a MapReduce program to calculate for each
conference the number of papers.
Requirement: Please include your MapReduce pseudo code (or real
Java code) and the detailed description of your algorithm including
main functions (and their functionalities), execution steps,
performance analysis in the report.

PART B: Big Data Project Analysis

Precision agriculture (PA) is the science of improving crop yields and
assisting management decisions using high technology sensor and
analysis tools. The AgrBIG company is a leading provider of
agronomy services, technology and strategic advice. They plan to
develop a big data system. The users can be farmers, research
laboratories, policy makers, public administration, consulting or
logistic companies, etc. The system aims to help worldwide users
better understanding the implications of the weather and making
contingency plans; buying supplies, such as fertilizer and seeds; as
well as maintaining and monitoring the quality of yield, whether
livestock or crops; knowing the variety of cultivated plants,
conditions of its growth and its needs of seeds; choosing the type of
fertilizer and pesticides, understanding their employment conditions
and their impact on the climate- soil-plant; recognizing daily water
needs for each kind of plant; calculating the median and mean values
of yield; studying the conditions of natural environment; estimating
the financial revenue and manage the potential risks.
The sources of data will be from various Sensors, Satellites, Drones,
Social media, Market data, Online news feed, Logistic Corporate data,
etc..
Example Data
Streaming  : Soil Sensor data, Streaming
             Agricultural product prices (from
             Market data vendors)
Batch : Historical Weather Data
On-Line : Online news feed
Unstructured : Satellite Image Data, Drone
               Video Data, Text

Note that some data such as price and customer data are confidential.
The data volume is expected to be 300 Petabytes. The applications
need to be highly available, scalable and accessible from worldwide.
You need to design a big data project by solving the following tasks
for the AgrBIG company:

Task1 (25 marks): Produce a Big Data Architecture for the AgrBIG
company with the following components in detail:
- Data sources,
- Data extraction and cleaning,
- Data storage,
- Batch processing,
- Real time message ingestion,
- Analytical Data store
For each of the above, discuss various options and produce your
recommendation which best meets the business requirement.

Task2 (10 marks): The AgrBIG company needs to store a large
collection of plants, corps, diseases, symptoms, pests and their
relationships. They also want to facilitate queries such as: "find all
corn diseases which are directly or indirectly caused by Zinc
deficiency". Please recommend a data store for that purpose and
justify your choice.

Task3 (10 marks): MapReduce has become the standard for
performing batch processing on big data analysis tasks. However,
data analysists and researchers in the AgrBIG company found that
MapReduce coding can be quite challenging to them for data analysis
tasks. Please recommend an alternative way for those people who are
more familiar with SQL language to do the data analysis tasks or
business intelligence tasks on big data and justify your
recommendation.

Task 4 (15 marks): The AgrBIG company needs near real time
performance for some services such as soil moisture prediction
service. It has been suggested the parallel distributed processing on a
cluster should use MapReduce to process this requirement. Provide a
detailed assessment of whether MapReduce is optimal to meet this
requirement and If not, what would be the best approach.

Task 5 (10 marks): Design a detailed hosting strategy for this Big
Data project and how this will meet the scalability, high availability
requirements for this global business.
